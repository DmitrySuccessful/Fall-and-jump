# Bubble Pop

A fun HTML5 Canvas arcade game where players need to pop colorful bubbles before they float away!

## Game Description

Bubble Pop is a simple yet addictive game where colorful bubbles float up from the bottom of the screen. Your goal is to pop as many bubbles as possible by clicking on them. Each popped bubble adds to your score, with larger bubbles worth more points. But be careful - if a bubble floats off the top of the screen or if you miss when clicking, you'll lose a life! The game gets progressively harder as bubbles start moving faster and appearing more frequently.
